### Introduction
_On May 22, 1980, the Pac-Man video game was released in Japan and by October of the same year, it was released in the United States. The yellow, pie-shaped Pac-Man character, who travels around a maze trying to eat dots and avoid four mean ghosts, quickly became an icon of the 1980s. To this day, Pac-Man remains one of the most popular video games in history._

## Process
_First I started to write pseudo code on the Trello .Then,I started to do  html things for the game.I tried to do my web page Semantic web page.Then,I gave some css for my web pages.Then,I started to do JavaScript.First,I created my maze and  added Pacman, ghosts, cherries, and pineapples.Then,I did Pacman movements and eating fruits.Then,I did Ghosts movements.I tried to do ghost following Pacman.Then,I did Pacman eats When Ghosts turn to blue .I spent my time with JavaScript mostly.I would do score board for scores next time._

### Challenges
_The hardest part is Ghosts following Pacman logically. It took time to understand ghosts behaviours.I was thinking this thing is Al .I needed to think  all possibilities a lot.I searched this things on google.Their behaviours were so simple.I thought simple for this issue.I tried to break down this problem to small pieces.And,I manage to solve this problem.I do not need to think complex for any problem .Think simple and break down this problem to small pieces._

### Wins
_I really enjoyed what I did .I am so proud of Ghost Following Pacman. This project helped me to understand time management about projects.First thing,Write pseudo.Second thing,Do some html and css to see every things properly.Third thing,Play hard for JavaScript.When JavaScript works properly.Give more time doing  css._

## Future features
_I am going to do more CSS to make my web page beautiful.I am going to different mazes for game and try to do scoreboard._
